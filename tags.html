	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>This is Katherine's website.</p>
	<p>Go Dawgs!</p>
	<p>I am a sophomore at UW intending to major in Business Administration. My hobbies include playing guitar, going to concerts, watching movies, making food, and meeting new people! My favorite song right now is "Boredom" by Tyler the Creator, and I'm going to see him perform live on November 3rd. Don't ask me how expensive my ticket was.</p>
